# Setup

To get started fork this repo and clone your fork into a cloud nine workspace.

Then run:

    npm install

    npm start


The first command install the code this project depends on, you only need to run
this command once.

The second command serves the project locally.

Once you are able to view the slackr app go through the code to find the `TODO`s
to complete your project and add cool features.

Here's a demo of a minimal completed project:

# References

Here are the relevant documentation resources for this project. Please
familiarize yourself with them so you know where to look things up!

This project uses [React](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html) and 
[Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/js/).

The library [re-base](https://github.com/tylermcginnis/re-base#api) helps it
glue Firebase and React together.

The library [material-ui](https://material-ui-next.com/) is used for nice
looking React components. Look through the component demos to see what you can
use it for!

Finally the code behind the `npm start` command comes from
[create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app#create-react-app-).
It also makes `npm run build` available which you will later use to publish your
slackr project.
